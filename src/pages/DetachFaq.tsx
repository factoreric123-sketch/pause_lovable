  {
    question: "How is Detach different from Apple Screen Time?",
    answer:
      "Screen Time limits are easy to bypass. A tap on 'ignore limit' or a passcode you already know and you are back in. Detach creates physical separation. Blocked apps stay blocked until you tap the Detach card, which you keep somewhere outside easy reach. That physical step is what makes the habit stick.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can’t I just delete the app or find a workaround?",
    answer:
      "We built Detach with Strict Mode for exactly this. In Strict Mode, which is optional, you can not delete the app when a detach session is active.",
  },
  {
    question: "What’s included with a Detach purchase?",
    answer:
      "Your purchase includes the physical Detach card and full access to the Detach iPhone app. No subscriptions, no extra fees. Buy once, use forever.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Detach ship internationally?",
    answer: "Yes. We ship worldwide and shipping is free.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my phone compatible with Detach?",
    answer:
      "Detach currently works with iPhones running iOS 17.0 or later. An Android version is coming soon.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Detach available on Android?",
    answer:
      "Not yet. Detach is currently iPhone only. An Android version is in development and will be released soon.",
  },
  {
    question: "What can I block with Detach?",
    answer:
      "You can block iPhone apps and selected websites in browsers.",
  },
  {
    question: "How many apps can I block with Detach?",
    answer:
      "Up to 50 apps per configuration. Apple's Screen Time API has a hard limit of 50 individual apps per block setup.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I lose my Detach card?",
    answer:
      "Accidents happen. You can configure a limited number of emergency unlocks in the app so you are not permanently locked out. If you run out of emergency unlocks and you are also in strict mode, please reach out to us and we will help disable Detach.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Detach track your data?",
    answer:
      "No. Your blocking information and session history are stored locally on your phone. Detach cannot see or access your block lists or session data.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I set up Detach with my iPhone?",
    answer:
      "1. Download the free Detach app from the App Store. 2. Grant Screen Time permission so the app can block apps at the system level. 3. Choose the apps and websites to block. 4. Start a session. 5. Scan your Detach card to stop a session.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I block apps without my card?",
    answer: "Yes. You can start a focus session manually from the app without the card.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I block websites?",
    answer:
      "Yes. You can block selected websites.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is the app free?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The Detach app is free to download and use. There are no hidden fees or subscriptions. The only purchase is the Detach card, which is $9.99 one time.",
