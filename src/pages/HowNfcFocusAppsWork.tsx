          <Quotable>
            An NFC focus app blocks selected apps through the phone's operating system and only lifts
            the block when the phone reads a physical NFC card. The tap is a hardware event, so ending
            a session requires being next to the card instead of remembering a passcode.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
              NFC is short range wireless communication that works over a couple of centimeters. The
              card is passive: it has no battery and does nothing until an iPhone's NFC reader powers
              it during the tap. The card sends a small identifier, the app recognizes it, and the
              block ends. Nothing is transmitted over the internet and no personal data is stored on
              the card.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Because the trigger is physical, the app can be strict without being fragile. A blocker
              that asks for a passcode is only as strong as your willpower in the moment. A blocker
              that asks you to stand up is strong by default.
