            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              By downloading and using Detach, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              Detach is a digital wellness tool that helps you manage screen time by blocking apps and websites
              during focus sessions. The app uses Apple's Screen Time API and NFC technology to provide its functionality.
              You are responsible for your own use of the app and any consequences thereof.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3">Strict Mode</h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              When Strict Mode is enabled, you cannot end a focus session by deleting the app.
              By enabling Strict Mode, you acknowledge that you are voluntarily restricting your ability to
              end sessions early. Detach is not responsible for any inconvenience caused by Strict Mode.

            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3">Emergency Overrides</h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              Emergency overrides allow you to end a session without tapping your NFC tag.
              These are limited in number and intended only for genuine emergencies.
              Misuse of emergency overrides is at your own discretion and responsibility.
